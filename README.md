# LeetCode Tracker LMS

A robust, two-sided Learning Management System designed for educators and students to seamlessly track LeetCode progress, manage classroom assignments, and view dynamic leaderboards. 

This platform automates the tracking of coding assignments by integrating directly with LeetCode's external APIs, eliminating manual grading while providing a gamified experience for students.

## Features

* **Role-Based Access Control:** Distinct dashboards and permissions for Super Admins, Mentors, and Students.
* **Enterprise Security:** Stateless JWT authentication utilizing short-lived access tokens and secure, HTTP-Only refresh token rotation.
* **OAuth2 Integration:** Seamless "Login with Google" flow for rapid onboarding.
* **Automated LeetCode Synchronization:** Instantly fetches a student's total solved problems, contest ratings, badges, and recent submissions upon registration.
* **Classroom Management:** Mentors can create classrooms, enroll students, and assign specific LeetCode problems with strict time windows.
* **Dynamic Leaderboards:** Real-time sorting based on consistency streaks, contest ratings, or pending assignments.
* **Submission Validation:** Automated regex and API-driven verification to ensure students actually completed the assigned problems.
